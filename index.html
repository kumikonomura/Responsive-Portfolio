                <p>Hi my name is Kumiko. I graduated from the University of La Verne in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science
                    in Accounting. I currently work as an accountant. My job involves a lot of analyzing, reconciling, and solving
                    financial problems. It's hard work but there are aspects to it that I like. One of the best feelings is able to
                    figure out a complex financial puzzle. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of my favorite hobbies are exercising, reading, cooking,
                    playing music, and traveling. When it comes to exercising I like to
                    run, swim, play basketball, and more. As long as it's a challenge, it's something I enjoy. Reading
                    has been a passion of mine since youth. Some of my favorite books include
                    Oliver Twist, The Great Gatsby, and 1984. I love the classics, but also any good mystery or fantasy
                    book. Music has been a part of my life since I was little.
                    I started playing piano when I was six years old and my fond of music grew from that. Lastly,
                    traveling is one my favorite things to do. I love experiencing new cultures, food,
                    people, and historic landmarks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think this course will help me grow professionally and enable me with a good set of skills. I'm hoping to get into a job position
                    where both my financial background and new coding skills will be utilized. 
                </p>
